Our project is “PastoralismBook”.

This project will help pastoralist communities around the world preserve their livelihood by providing them access to information and resources to prepare and support their migration journey.
An user can access this service through a Smartphone app and a website which provide simple and straightforward advices to help the management of the pastoralist.

We are going to complete our project using 3 different stages.
ð  Input -> Process -> Output

 

1.     Input:

There are 2 ways to get Input.
(i)                  From NASA’s Given Data. Ex: http://data.nasa.gov

(ii)                Developing a fully functional embedded system design to calculate and storage value to central Database. We can able to accept the value of Temperature, Rain, Humidity, Wind Speed, Wind Direction and Barometric Presser from that device where the machine will deploy.

2.       Processing:

This platform is working like a universal platform to control whole system. This is a smart Web Application containing all result with a central database.

(i)                  After Receiving The value from machine or Receiving the data from  http://data.nasa.gov, all data will process and store in Database. Like: Temperature, Rain, Humidity, Wind Speed, Wind Direction and Barometric Presser by tracking location of the machine and the number of the machine.

(ii)                View the result in Web Application which is sorted by the name of area.

(iii)               To communicate with pastoralist or there self a social relation app or a blog site will given here

(iv)              Send specified value to mobile application.

 

3.     Output:

In this stage we will show a mobile app that can able to communicate web Application directly depending users requirement. An user Will receive full feature here.

(i)                  An user can able to know about the destination’s current weather and about the nature.

(ii)                An user can able to know the safe root to go to his destination with a map.

(iii)               Also able to know nearby Hospital, Police Station, Market etc.

When an user without a smart phone also able to access this application using the Web Site by Any internet access able device.

In some countries a weather station provides data to whole city based on a  only station.
We don't Know our project is the most innovative ever.
But we strongly believe, if we get the permission to set up each weather stations with in range of 1 K.M. - pastoralist or all other users can get some current information about the weather based on there current location.
And Its possible because it won't cased a lot. Even Its cheap enough to built a weather station in every single houses.

Normally pastoralists lead there life with there practical experiences. So if we can implement our system among them, they'll be start using technologies beside there own experiences. They will start communicate with other cultures and expending there businesses easily with our app. Our system will help them in emergency situations too.
    So this can make a huge change in their life how they are normally operating now.

Normally we can get weather information from web site like: data.nasa.gov. So people develop systems by getting information's from those servers and give those outputs to some kind of android Apps or like that.
But we propose to use our own weather station besides the NASA's Data. Our weather station can provide information with updates of every single minute to our web server. Then the server will process and deliver the information to the user through our user user friendly Android App.
